#Observations:
# 1) Gaming is heavily male oriented at 84+%, compared to the combined female/other/non-disclosed participation rate of 15%
# 2) The 15 to 30 demographic are by far the least patient/istant gratification,
#    and are willing to buy skills/tools rather than earn them in game play
# 3) This game is most popular with the 15-30 demo, which should influence where marketing dollars are spent.
