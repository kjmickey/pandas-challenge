 Homework due Dec 16

Update 12/16:  I did Heroes of Pymoli, file name is HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb

Obeservations are at the end of the Jupyter notebook and also in the text file "Observations of HoP.txt"

12/12 - I haven't decided which one to do, so I'm setting up git for both.

Options are Heroes of Pymoli (HeroesOfPymoli) or Py City Schools (PyCitySchools).
